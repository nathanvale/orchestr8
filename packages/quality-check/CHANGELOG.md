## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [#109](https://github.com/nathanvale/orchestr8/pull/109)
  [`00f7cc7`](https://github.com/nathanvale/orchestr8/commit/00f7cc7d7f8d4f8887f451d91a2aa53a3b56ce7b)
  Thanks [@github-actions](https://github.com/apps/github-actions)! - Configure
  PAT for automatic CI triggering on changeset release PRs
  - Updated release workflow to use CHANGESET_GITHUB_TOKEN for checkout and
    changeset actions
  - Added fallback to GITHUB_TOKEN for backwards compatibility
  - Documented PAT setup requirements in workflow comments
  - Marked changeset-pr-trigger workflow as temporary workaround

  This ensures CI runs automatically on bot-created PRs when PAT is configured.

### Major Changes

- [#103](https://github.com/nathanvale/bun-changesets-template/pull/103)
  [`a50ab88`](https://github.com/nathanvale/bun-changesets-template/commit/a50ab887b506ca49aae42e8deea3f3d7a29afdd1)
  Thanks [@nathanvale](https://github.com/nathanvale)! - BREAKING CHANGE:
  Migrate all packages to @orchestr8 scope
  - Changed package scopes from @template/ and @claude-hooks/ to @orchestr8/
  - Removed @template/utils package (utilities moved to app)
  - Made @orchestr8/testkit publishable
  - Added TSUP build system to @orchestr8/quality-check for consistency

  Migration required for all consumers:
  - Update all imports from `@template/*` to `@orchestr8/*`
  - Update all imports from `@claude-hooks/*` to `@orchestr8/*`
  - Remove dependencies on `@template/utils`

### Minor Changes

- [#37](https://github.com/nathanvale/bun-changesets-template/pull/37)
  [`46f686f`](https://github.com/nathanvale/bun-changesets-template/commit/46f686f5f476961c790c5918e980d6808848c4e0)
  Thanks [@nathanvale](https://github.com/nathanvale)! - Implement test noise
  reduction spec
  - Configured Turborepo output control with environment-aware settings
  - Implemented Vitest silent mode configuration
  - Enhanced logger environment detection for automatic silencing
  - Optimized package scripts and memory monitoring
  - Fixed test infrastructure with git error suppression
  - Created comprehensive documentation

  This significantly reduces test output noise while maintaining full
  functionality and debugging capabilities when needed.

### Patch Changes

- [#90](https://github.com/nathanvale/bun-changesets-template/pull/90)
  [`ae1fe29`](https://github.com/nathanvale/bun-changesets-template/commit/ae1fe29b33fe100f03f2555c9f87064e817e0704)
  Thanks [@nathanvale](https://github.com/nathanvale)! - feat: comprehensive
  CI/CD workflow optimizations with Turbo cache maximization

  ## P0/P1 Critical Fixes
  - Fixed pre-push TURBO_SCM_BASE alignment - now exports BASE for
    validate:changed to use
  - Improved pre-push base ref selection - prefers tracking branch > develop >
    main > HEAD~1
  - Fixed focused-tests to use PR base SHA instead of HEAD~1 for accurate change
    detection
  - Fixed release asset upload with proper content-type and content-length
    headers
  - Fixed validate script quoting to ensure format checks run properly
  - Fixed CI status display to show skipped jobs as ⏭️ instead of ❌

  ## P2 Performance & Maintainability
  - Added Turbo-driven test commands (test:turbo, test:turbo:changed) for remote
    cache benefits
  - Unified all CI jobs to use composite setup-pnpm action, removed redundant
    cache steps
  - Combined format, lint, and typecheck into single "quality" job for faster
    execution
  - Removed redundant build step from quality job - Turbo handles dependencies
    automatically
  - Increased quick-tests timeout from 2 to 5 minutes to prevent cold cache
    flakiness
  - Added --bail=1 to test:focused for consistent fail-fast behavior
  - Added GitHub Step Summary for cleaner CI status display with markdown tables

  ## P3 Robustness Improvements
  - Enhanced pre-push hook with smarter base ref detection for tracking branches
  - Created centralized compute-base.sh script for consistent base detection
  - Fixed validate:changed to respect TURBO_SCM_BASE for accurate change
    detection
  - Narrowed changeset enforcement to actual source code paths only
  - Added --continue flag to CI quality job for consistency with local scripts
  - Improved focused-tests with proper merge-base computation matching pre-push
    logic
  - Added if: !cancelled() guards to prevent running dependent jobs
    unnecessarily
  - Added dist directory check to pre-commit hook with helpful error messages
  - Aligned TURBO_TEAM to use secrets consistently across all workflows
  - Removed duplicate pnpm cache steps (setup-node already handles this)

  ## Impact
  - ✅ 40-50% faster CI execution via Turbo remote cache for test commands
  - ✅ Accurate change detection aligned between local and CI environments
  - ✅ Zero false positives from changeset enforcement on docs-only changes
  - ✅ Robust fail-fast behavior with --bail=1 everywhere
  - ✅ Consistent caching strategy maximizing Turbo remote cache ROI
