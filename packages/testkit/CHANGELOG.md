  [`d6e5c11`](https://github.com/nathanvale/orchestr8/commit/d6e5c116d0dcda8366360c2d3660fbb531f2a31c)
  Thanks [@nathanvale](https://github.com/nathanvale)! - Add pre-configured test
  setup module with automatic resource cleanup

  Introduces `@orchestr8/testkit/setup` and `@orchestr8/testkit/setup/auto`
  modules to eliminate test-setup.ts boilerplate across packages.

  **Features:**
  - `@orchestr8/testkit/setup` - Manual configuration with `createTestSetup()`
    factory
  - `@orchestr8/testkit/setup/auto` - Zero-config auto-executing setup for
    vitest setupFiles
  - Centralized resource cleanup with sensible defaults
  - Optional package name logging and statistics
  - Full TypeScript support with proper type exports

  **Usage:**

  Zero-config (auto-executing):

  ```typescript
  // vitest.config.ts
  export default defineConfig({
    test: {
      setupFiles: ['@orchestr8/testkit/setup/auto'],
    },
  })
  ```

  Custom configuration:

  ```typescript
  import { createTestSetup } from '@orchestr8/testkit/setup'

  await createTestSetup({
    packageName: 'my-package',
    cleanupAfterEach: false,
    logStats: true,
  })
  ```

  This eliminates 101 lines of duplicated boilerplate code across packages.

  [`4b77652`](https://github.com/nathanvale/orchestr8/commit/4b776529cdc42ad3ce6ae8e85339bf106058abd7)
  Thanks [@nathanvale](https://github.com/nathanvale)! - fix: clear setTimeout
  in createExitHandler to prevent file handle leaks

  **Critical Bug Fix:** Resolves issue where hundreds of uncanceled setTimeout
  calls in `createExitHandler` prevented natural process exit, causing tests to
  hang for 20+ seconds even with guards enabled.

  **Root Cause:** The `createExitHandler` function created a setTimeout for
  timeout detection but never cleared it when cleanup completed successfully.
  These orphaned timeouts accumulated as file handles (248 in affected test
  suites), preventing the Node.js process from exiting naturally.

  **Solution:** Added a `finally` block to clear the timeout handle after
  `Promise.race` completes, ensuring proper cleanup regardless of the
  success/failure path.

  **Impact:**
  - ✅ Eliminates hundreds of file handle leaks
  - ✅ Enables natural process exit in <5 seconds (previously 120+ seconds)
  - ✅ No timeout wrappers needed for fork pool configurations
  - ✅ Fixes all "unknown stack trace" FILEHANDLE leaks pointing to
    process-listeners.js

  **Breaking:** None - this is a pure bug fix with no API changes.

### Patch Changes

- [#167](https://github.com/nathanvale/orchestr8/pull/167)
  [`45c1231`](https://github.com/nathanvale/orchestr8/commit/45c1231f1ef52684acc8b12f33ad0072e7313822)
  Thanks [@nathanvale](https://github.com/nathanvale)! - fix: cleanup process
  listeners in afterAll and parent process to prevent hanging

  Fixes issue where 98 file handles remain open after tests complete, preventing
  the Node.js process from exiting naturally. Process would hang indefinitely
  requiring timeout wrappers or manual termination.

  **Root Cause:** register.ts called removeAllProcessListeners() in afterEach
  but NOT in afterAll. Additionally, with Vitest's fork pool architecture, the
  parent coordinator process never executes afterAll hooks, leaving its process
  listeners attached permanently.

  **Solution:**
  1. Added removeAllProcessListeners() to afterAll hook for fork workers
  2. Added process.on('exit') cleanup handler for parent process (fork pool
     coordinator)

  This ensures process listeners are cleaned up in both scenarios:
  - Fork workers: afterAll hook executes after test files complete
  - Parent process: exit handler executes when coordinator process terminates

  **Impact:**
  - Eliminates need for timeout wrappers in package.json
  - Natural process exit after tests complete
  - Better developer experience
  - Resolves hanging process issue with Vitest fork pools
  - Handles both single-worker and fork-pool scenarios

### Minor Changes

- [#165](https://github.com/nathanvale/orchestr8/pull/165)
  [`fb8eb41`](https://github.com/nathanvale/orchestr8/commit/fb8eb41f216fcba4b1f652dfe31721b6933809ae)
  Thanks [@nathanvale](https://github.com/nathanvale)! - feat: add SQLite leak
  guard and open-handle hygiene

  Adds automatic detection and cleanup of resource leaks (SQLite databases,
  timers) that prevent Vitest processes from exiting cleanly.

  **Features:**
  - SQLite Leak Guard: auto-closes leaked better-sqlite3 connections
  - Timers Guard: auto-clears leaked setTimeout/setInterval
  - Hanging-Process Reporter: auto-enables in CI for debugging
  - Strict mode: fails tests if leaks detected
  - Verbose mode: logs forced closures for debugging

  **Configuration (opt-in):**
  - `TESTKIT_SQLITE_GUARD=on` - Enable SQLite leak detection
  - `TESTKIT_SQLITE_GUARD_STRICT=on` - Fail on leaks
  - `TESTKIT_SQLITE_GUARD_VERBOSE=on` - Log closures
  - `TESTKIT_TIMERS_GUARD=on` - Enable timer cleanup
  - `TESTKIT_REPORT_HANGS=on` - Enable hanging-process reporter (default in CI)

  **Usage:**

  ```bash
  export TESTKIT_SQLITE_GUARD=on
  pnpm test
  ```

  Fixes hanging Vitest processes that timeout after 20+ seconds. With guards
  enabled, processes exit cleanly within 2 seconds.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#152](https://github.com/nathanvale/orchestr8/pull/152)
  [`3b79cad`](https://github.com/nathanvale/orchestr8/commit/3b79cad64498ced5e0cdd70fe6664c48c9554055)
  Thanks [@nathanvale](https://github.com/nathanvale)! - **BREAKING CHANGE**:
  Remove `defineVitestConfig` to fix "Vitest failed to access its internal
  state" error

  ## What Changed
  - **Removed**: `defineVitestConfig` function and export
  - **Fixed**: Config helpers no longer import vitest internals during config
    loading
  - **Fixed**: Made vitest-resources imports lazy to prevent config-time loading

  ## Why This Change

  Vitest config files cannot import vitest internals (like `defineConfig`,
  `beforeEach`, `afterEach`) because these require the vitest runtime to be
  initialized. When `defineVitestConfig` imported `defineConfig` from
  `vitest/config`, it caused the error:

  ```
  Error: Vitest failed to access its internal state.
  - "vitest" is imported inside Vite / Vitest config file
  ```

  This prevented any project using TestKit's config helpers from running tests.

  ## Migration Guide

  **Before:**

  ```typescript
  import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'
  import { defineVitestConfig } from '@orchestr8/testkit/config'

  export default defineVitestConfig({
    test: {
      name: 'my-package',
      environment: 'node',
    },
  })
  ```

  **After:**

  ```typescript
  import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'
  import { createBaseVitestConfig } from '@orchestr8/testkit/config'

  export default defineConfig(
    createBaseVitestConfig({
      test: {
        name: 'my-package',
        environment: 'node',
      },
    }),
  )
  ```

  ## Impact
  - **Breaking**: Projects using `defineVitestConfig` must update to use
    `createBaseVitestConfig` wrapped in `defineConfig`
  - **Fixed**: All config helpers now work correctly without triggering vitest
    state errors
  - **Improved**: Resource cleanup functions are now async (prevents config-time
    vitest imports)

  JavaScript files were not being generated correctly when using tsup with
  bundle: false for ESM builds.

  **Changes:**
  - Added .js extensions to utils/concurrency and object-pool imports
  - Added .js extension to msw/handlers import

  **Impact:**
  - dist/utils/concurrency.js now generates correctly
